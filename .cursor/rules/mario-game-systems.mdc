# Mario Game Systems Guide

This rule covers the main gameplay systems used in the Mario game.

## Animation System
- Objects track `animationFrame` and `animationTimer`
- Player animations: idle, 4-frame walking (8 frame timing), jumping
- Enemy animations follow similar patterns (e.g., Goomba 2-frame bounce)
- Animations tie into physics, collisions, particles, sound, and rendering

## Enemy Variety
- Five enemy types: **Goomba**, **Koopa**, **Flying**, **Boss**, and **Koopa Shell**
- Each has unique movement and AI behavior
- To add an enemy: create update logic, animations, collision handling, and drawing functions

## Power-ups
- **Mushroom** grows Mario
- **Fire Flower** enables fireball attacks
- **Star** grants temporary invincibility
- Player tracks `powerUpState` and `starTimer`
- Fireballs bounce with gravity and expire after a short time

## Sound System
- Implemented with the Web Audio API
- Sounds: jump, coin, enemy defeat, game over, background music
- Toggle audio with the **M** key and on-screen button
- Keep UI in sync with sound state and clean up music on restart

## Integration Notes
- Systems share data via the global `gameState` object
- Keep update loops efficient to maintain 60 FPS
